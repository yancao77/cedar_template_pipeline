This is just the file name and does not included any path information A title or descriptive name by which the data-file being described is known. This is a presentation name (i.e. title case with appropriate spacing) and is typically different from the actual file name of the data file.

Multiple titles and different languages may be specified. The string identifying the version of the data-file.

This field accepts any version string, but we suggest that semantic versioning of the form `major.minor.patch`. for example, `2.1.4`, is used. A SHA256 digest of the Data File contents. This is a 64 characters long hexadecimal string. 

For example, the SHA256 digest of the string, ""RADx Data Hub"" is `ebff8d3da88b292622d3bfc36bdac4c4537ddc56cb07f344c5223d6b6f9cd011`.

On macOS the following command may be used to generate the SHA256 digest of a file.

```
shasum -a 256 /path/to/file
``` A description of the data file contents. A globally unique string that identifies the Data File being described. It is typically a DOI (Digital Object Identifier) or IRI (International Resource Identifier, or Web address). The identifier is typically generated by data providers or data publishers who wish to have a citable and Web-accessible resource.

Example DOIs are `doi:10.1000/182` or `https://doi.org/10.1000/182`, both of which identify the DOI Handbook, which has a DOI of 10.1000/182

See also:  [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_object_identifier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_object_identifier) The primary language used to present the data-file (if multiple languages are present, the _Other Languages_ field may be used to add additional languages). A list of other, non-primary, languages in which the data file being described is provided. The Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) subject code that identifies a classification subject that is pertinent to the data file. Free text subject, keyword, classification code, or key phrase describing the data file or purpose for which the data file can be used. While MeSH codes are the preferred form of specifying subjects this free text field may be used for codes or subject keywords that do not have a corresponding MeSH terms. The file name of the Data Dictionary file that defines the Data File's data elements.

Each Data File submitted should have its own data dictionary. For example, survery_results_origcopy.csv and survery_results_transformcopy.csv should both have data dictionary files (survery_results_origcopy_DICT.csv and survery_results_transformcopy_DICT.csv) associated with them.
