"Introduction",""
"This document includes a single-page mapping (Specifications Mapping tab) that relates the Dataset metadata model of DataCite 3.4, the in-progress CEDAR RADx Dataset Model, and desires collected from some of the RADx DCCs. Ths datasets described by this specification are typically a single data file, not a collection of data files, as many attributes describe a single file.",""
"It is provided for users to review the proposed first metadata specification for RADx datasets. The specification is to be used by RADx DCCs to describe their datasets as soon as they are ready to do so. The specification is encoded in CEDAR templates, so that the DCC-provided metadata can be formatted as JSON-LD CEDAR instances. ",""
"As described further in the Key, in this iteration of data submissions, no metadata fields are explicitly required. We make strong recommendations for the use of a number of the fields, to encourage consistent reporting of metadata that is likely to be available to the DCCs for each dataset.",""
"(Note that while the proposed format can include a description of CDEs, this is neither expected nor encouraged in the first efforts to adopt the specification.)",""

"How to Use",""
"If you want to understand what detailed attributes can be submitted using this specification, you can use column D directly.",""
"If we you want to understand how we arrived at any given attribute, you can see the equivalent attribute in columns B (DataCite), and the other columns for RADx DCC metadata specifications. 

To understand details about the DataCite and other specifications, go to the tab for that specification. It usually includes raw materials for understanding the specification's attributes.",""
