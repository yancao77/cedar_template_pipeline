At least one Data File Title is required.  Mutliple values may be specified to provide titles in different languages. A title or descriptive name by which the Data File being described is known. This is a presentation name (i.e. title case with appropriate spacing) and is typically different from the actual file name of the data file.

Multiple titles and different languages may be specified by repeating this element. The language for a given title is specified with the Language field. The language tag that identifies the language in which the Data File Title is provided. Languages are identified using codes that are structured in accordance with [RFC 5646](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5646). If no value is specified then the default code of `en` for English is assumed. Information used to identify the Data File being described. A globally unique string that identifies the Data File being described. It is typically a DOI (Digital Object Identifier) or IRI (International Resource Identifier, or Web address). The identifier is typically generated by data providers or data publishers who wish to have a citable and Web-accessible resource.

Example DOIs are `doi:10.1000/182` or `https://doi.org/10.1000/182`, both of which identify the DOI Handbook, which has a DOI of 10.1000/182

See also:  [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_object_identifier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_object_identifier) The identifier type used to identify the resource being described.

This need not be provided if the identifier is either a DOI that begins with ""doi:"" or ""https://doi.org/"", or it is an IRI that begins with either ""http://"" or ""https://""  The local name of the resource (for example, in a file-based operating system or web service). The string identifying the version of the data file or other resource being described.

This field accepts any version string, but we suggest that you use semantic versioning of the form `major.minor.patch`. for example, `2.1.4`. A SHA256 digest of the Data File contents. This is a 64 characters long hexadecimal string. 

For example, the SHA256 digest of the string, ""RADx Data Hub"" is `ebff8d3da88b292622d3bfc36bdac4c4537ddc56cb07f344c5223d6b6f9cd011`.

On macOS the following command may be used to generate the SHA256 digest of a file.

```
shasum -a 256 /path/to/file
``` Language in which the data file being described is provided. Primary language used to present the data file (if multiple languages are present, the _Other Languages_ field may be used to add additional languages). A list of other, non-primary, languages in which the data file being described is provided. A list of concepts (keywords, classification, or free text terms) that define the data file or purpose (subjects which can be addressed) using the data file. The Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) subject code that identifies a classification subject that is pertinent to the data file. The name of the scheme or authority used for the Subject Identifier. Free text subject, keyword, classification code, or key phrase describing the data file or purpose for which the data file can be used. While MeSH codes are the preferred form of specifying subjects this free text field may be used for codes or subject keywords that do not have a corresponding MeSH terms. A list of summaries of the Data File and its contents. An account of the resource contained in the Data File; may include but is not limited to: an abstract, a table of contents, a graphical representation, or a free-text account of the resource. Language in which the Data File description is provided. The default value is `en` for English. This is the type of digital object being described, which for RADx Data Files is always [Dataset](http://vocab.fairdatacollective.org/gdmt/Dataset).  Information about the Data Dictionary associated with the Data File The file name of the Data Dictionary file that defines the Data File's data elements.

Each Data File submitted should have its own data dictionary. For example, survery_results_origcopy.csv and survery_results_transformcopy.csv should both have data dictionary files (survery_results_origcopy_DICT.csv and survery_results_transformcopy_DICT.csv) associated with them.  A list of people and/or organizations that created the data file. The type of the creator. This is either a Person or an Organization. The full name of the creator. For a person this is the combination of the given name and family name, in the appropriate order. If the creator is a person, the personal name(s) of the creator (e.g., first and optionally middle name in Western languagues, optionally middle and last name in Asian languages). If the creator is a person, the surname(s) of the creator (e.g., last name in Western languagues, first name in Asian languages). Globally unique string that identifies the creator (an individual or legal entity). For individuals, this is typically an ORCID; for research organizations, it is typically an ROR.

The ORCID iD is an https IRI with a 16-digit number that is compatible with the ISO Standard (ISO 27729), also known as the International Standard Name Identifier (ISNI), e.g. https://orcid.org/0000-0001-2345-6789

The identifier type used to identify the related resource. The local name of the related resource file (given by the operating system or web service), or for non-digital resources, the local name used to refer to it. Categorical type of the resource being described. (Corresponds to DataCite's resourceTypeGeneral.) For publications about the Data File, choose Text; for any other related publications, choose Text. For the Data Dictionary, choose Other Resource.  Description of the relationship of the related resource to the Data File being described. A list of people and/or organizations that contributed in bringing into existence the data file being described. While data file creators are also contributors, data file creators should be provided in the Data File Creator section instead of here The type of the contributor of the described data file (person or organization). The full name of the contributor. If the contributor is a person, the personal name(s) of the contributor (e.g., first and optionally middle name in Western languagues, optionally middle and last name in Asian languages). If the contributor is a person, the surname(s) of the conributor (e.g., last name in Western languagues, first name in Asian languages). Globally unique string that identifies the contributor (an individual or legal entity). For individuals, this is typically an ORCID; for research organizations, it is typically an ROR.

Text string describing any rights information for the data file being described.

If a uniquely identiable license is named above, it is not necessary to repeat the text of the license in this field. This field allows additional rights information to be provided, either to expand licensing terms, clarify the license holder, or provide unique license terms that are not available in a standardized license. A list of relevant dates related to the data file being described. Such dates pertain to some data-file-related event, for example ""creation date"", ""submission date"" etc. Dates are specified as a pair containing the actual date (in ISO-8601 format) and the event that the date relates to. See individual fields for specific examples.

The dates of some types of events can be captured by the RADx Data Hub, for example the ""Submitted"" date/time. Type of Data File event that the date is associated with. The Event Type is usually considered with respect to the corresponding actor; for example, Created is typically the initial creation of the Data File by its originator, Accepted is when an ingested Data File is approved (e.g., by the Data Hub), and Updated is the time of the most recent change to the Data File. The date/time that is specific to the associated event. 

Note that dates must be specified in [ISO-8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) format. This format specifies date/times in a locale neutral way with temporal components ordered largest to smallest, for example year, month, day. Note that times are in 24 hour clock (military time) format, thus 13:43 is 1:43pm. When times are specified a time zone must also be specified (Z or +00:00 indicates Greenwich Mean Time).

The date time 2022-11-23T01:23:45.678-07:00 specifies November 23, 2022 at just past 1:23am Pacific Daylight Time. Hyphens and colons are optional.
